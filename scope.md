# Project Scope: Minimal AI Chat Tool

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a web-based AI chat tool with a super minimal interface, inspired by the provided UI reference, supporting multiple projects.

**Core Focus:** A clean, light-themed interface with a sidebar navigation and centered chat input, prioritizing simplicity and usability.

**Target Users:** Users needing an efficient AI chat solution with project-specific organization.

## 2. Key Features

### Minimal Interface
- Single text input field for user queries
- Clean chat display area with minimal styling (e.g., simple text bubbles, no excessive buttons or menus)
- Monochromatic or limited color palette to maintain simplicity

### Multi-Project Support
- Ability to create and switch between multiple project-specific chat sessions
- Basic project organization (e.g., a dropdown or sidebar for project selection)

### AI Chat Functionality
- Integration with an AI model (e.g., via API like xAI's Grok API) for generating responses
- Support for text-based conversations with basic formatting (e.g., Markdown rendering for responses)

### Responsive Design
- Interface adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile devices

### Basic Persistence
- Store chat history per project in the browser (e.g., local storage) or a lightweight backend

### No Extra Features
- Exclude unnecessary elements like avatars, complex animations, or excessive settings to maintain minimalism

### Light Theme Design
- Implement a light theme with a white or light gray background
- Use dark text and minimal contrast elements (e.g., black input bar, dark buttons) for readability
- Draw inspiration from the provided UI reference with a light theme, featuring a clean, modern aesthetic

## 3. Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a lightweight framework (e.g., React with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- CDN-hosted dependencies to reduce setup complexity (e.g., React via cdn.jsdelivr.net)
- JSX for component-based development

### Backend (Optional)
- If persistence or AI integration requires a server, use a minimal Node.js/Express setup or serverless functions
- Connect to an AI API (e.g., xAI API at https://x.ai/api) for chat responses

### Storage
- Local storage for client-side chat history or a simple database (e.g., SQLite) for backend persistence

### Constraints
- No local file I/O for assets; rely on web-compatible resources
- Avoid complex forms (e.g., no `<form>` onSubmit due to sandbox restrictions)

## 4. User Interface Plan

### Layout
- Single-column layout with a fixed input bar at the bottom
- Chat history displayed in a scrollable area above the input
- Minimal project selector (e.g., a dropdown or compact sidebar) at the top

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for clean, utility-first styling
- Font: Simple, readable (e.g., Inter or Noto Sans)
- Colors: Light theme with a white (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#F5F5F5) background, dark gray (#333333) text, and subtle accents (e.g., #1A1A1A for input and buttons)

### Interactivity
- Real-time chat updates without page reloads
- Keyboard-focused input (e.g., press Enter to send messages)
- Minimal buttons (e.g., "New Project" and "Send")

## 5. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Prototype
- Build a static HTML/CSS/JS prototype with a single chat interface
- Mock AI responses for testing (no API integration yet)

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- Connect to an AI API for real chat functionality
- Implement basic project switching (e.g., local storage for project IDs)

### Phase 3: Polish and Testing
- Add responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Test chat persistence and project management
- Refine UI for minimalism and usability, ensuring the light theme is consistent

### Phase 4: Deployment
- Deploy as a single-page application (SPA) on a static host (e.g., Netlify or Vercel)
- Optional: Set up a lightweight backend if needed for persistence

## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users want a fast, lightweight tool with no learning curve
- AI API access is available (e.g., xAI API or similar)
- Projects are user-defined and do not require complex permissions or sharing

### Constraints
- Keep interface elements to a minimum to avoid clutter
- No support for multimedia (e.g., images, videos) in chats to maintain simplicity
- Browser-based; no native app development unless specified later

## 7. Success Criteria

- Interface loads in under 2 seconds on average devices
- Users can create and switch between at least 5 projects without performance issues
- Chat responses are displayed within 1-2 seconds of query submission (dependent on API performance)
- Interface remains clean and usable on screens as small as 320px wide, with the light theme enhancing readability

## 8. Technical Stack Summary

- **Frontend Framework:** React (via CDN)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Components:** JSX-based architecture
- **Storage:** Browser local storage (Phase 1), optional lightweight backend (Phase 4)
- **AI Integration:** API-based (OpenRouter preferred)
- **Deployment:** Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel recommended)
- **Performance:** <2s load, 1-2s response times, 320px+ mobile support
